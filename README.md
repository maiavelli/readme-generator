# README Generator

## Description
This is a command line application that uses node.js to generate a high-quality, professional README.md document for your projects and github repositories.

My motivation when creating this project was to create a simple application to generate READMEs, that would save time and allow developers  to spend more time actually working on their projects. I also took this as an opportunity to get more familiar with node.js and some of its packages.

## Installation
To install this application, please run an npm install on the package.json file via command line. Once the packages are installed, you may use the application by running 'node index.js' via command line.
